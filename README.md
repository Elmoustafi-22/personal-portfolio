# 🌟 Personal Portfolio  

A responsive and modern **personal portfolio** built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and react-icons.  
This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey to potential employers, collaborators, and clients.

- Explore my featured projects.  
- Download/view my resume.  
- Contact me through a simple form.  

The goal is to create a professional online presence that highlights my capabilities as a software engineer while ensuring performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy  

AI will be integrated into the development workflow in the following ways:  

### 1. Code / Feature Generation  
- Generate reusable React components (Navbar, Hero, Projects, Contact form).  
- Create TypeScript utility functions (scroll-to-top, date formatting, theme toggle).  
- Add docstrings and inline comments for readability.  

**Sample Prompt**:  
> “Generate a responsive React + TypeScript Navbar with TailwindCSS. Include a mobile hamburger menu and smooth scrolling links.”  

---

### 2. Testing Support  
- Use AI to scaffold unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library.  
- Generate snapshot tests for UI components to ensure design consistency.  

**Sample Prompt**:  
> “Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library for this ContactForm component. Ensure form validation works correctly.”  

---

### 3. Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation  
- AI will assist in writing TypeScript functions to fetch data from APIs (e.g., GitHub API for listing repositories or activity).  

**Sample Prompt**:  
> “Generate a TypeScript function to fetch repositories from the GitHub API, given a username. Include error handling and proper typings.”  

---

### 4. In-Editor / PR Review Tooling  
- **Tool of Choice**: Vs Code (with GitHub Copilot / CodeRabbit for PRs).  
- AI will support by:  
  - Generating commit messages from diffs.  
  - Reviewing PRs for best practices and TypeScript safety.  
  - Suggesting refactors for readability and efficiency.  

---

### 5. Documentation Support  
- AI will generate and refine README sections, docstrings, and inline comments.  
- AI will assist in writing setup instructions and feature documentation.  

**Sample Prompt**:  
> “Write a concise README section explaining how to clone, install dependencies, and run this portfolio project locally.”
