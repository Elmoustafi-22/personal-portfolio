## AI-Assisted Development: A Reflection on Building My Portfolio

Building my personal portfolio website with the assistance of an AI coding assistant was a fascinating and transformative experience. The process highlighted both the immense potential and the current limitations of AI in software development, and it taught me a great deal about how to effectively collaborate with a non-human partner.

What worked exceptionally well was the speed of initial setup and component creation. Tasks that would have taken me a significant amount of time, such as setting up the initial project structure, creating boilerplate code for components, and scaffolding out sections like the Hero, Projects, and Skills, were completed in a fraction of the time. The AI was able to take my high-level descriptions and translate them into functional React components with the specified styling and structure. This allowed me to focus more on the overall design and user experience rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of implementation details.

The AI also excelled at generating data structures and repetitive code. For example, when creating the `skills` data, I simply provided the names of the technologies and the AI was able to generate the corresponding SVG icons and links. This was a huge time-saver and it ensured consistency across the data.

However, the process was not without its limitations. The AI's understanding of my intent was not always perfect, and there were times when I had to intervene and make manual corrections. For example, the AI initially struggled with the layout of the project cards, and I had to provide more specific instructions to achieve the desired result. This highlighted the importance of clear and concise prompting. I learned that the more specific and detailed my prompts were, the better the AI was able to understand my requirements and generate the correct code.

Reviewing the AI-generated code was also a critical part of the process. While the AI was generally good at generating correct code, it was not infallible. I had to carefully review every line of code to ensure that it was correct, efficient, and followed best practices. This process of reviewing and iterating on the AI-generated code was a valuable learning experience in itself. It forced me to think critically about the code and to consider different ways of achieving the same result.

Overall, my experience with AI-assisted development was overwhelmingly positive. The AI was a powerful tool that helped me to build my portfolio website much faster than I would have been able to on my own. It also taught me a great deal about prompting, reviewing, and iterating on AI-generated code. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we build software, and I am excited to see how this technology will continue to evolve in the future.
